    <h3>Lyrics</h3>
    <p>
        Anyway I'm just gonna sing and play<br>
        Um, and I'm gonna play a song that you may know<br>
        That you may know<br>
        You're the light, you're the night<br>
        You're the color of my blood<br>
        You're the cure, you're the pain<br>
        You're the only thing I wanna touch<br>
        Never knew that it could mean so much, so much<br>
        You're the fear, I don't care<br>
        'Cause I've never been so high<br>
        Follow me through the dark<br>
        Let me take you past our satellites<br>
        You can see the world you brought to life, to life<br>
        So love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do<br>
        Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do<br>
        Touch me like you do, to-to-touch me like you do<br>
        What are you waiting for?<br>
        Fading in, fading out<br>
        On the edge of paradise<br>
        Every inch of your skin, is a Holy Grail I've gotta find<br>
        Only you can set my heart on fire, on fire<br>
        Yeah, I'll let you set the pace<br>
        'Cause I'm not thinking straight<br>
        My head's spinning around, I can't see clear no more<br>
        Oh, what are you waiting for?<br>
        Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do<br>
        Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do<br>
        Touch me like you do, to-to-touch me like you do, oh<br>
        What are you, what are you waiting for?<br>
        What are you waiting for?<br>
        Oh, I'll let you set the pace<br>
        Oh, 'cause I'm not thinking straight<br>
        Though my head's spinning around, I can't see clear no more<br>
        What are you waiting for?<br>
        Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do (Like you do, oh)<br>
        Oh, love me like you do<br>
        Touch me like you do, to-to-touch me like you do, oh<br>
        Oh, what are you waiting for?<br>
        Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do (Like you do)<br>
        Lo-lo-love me like you do<br>
        Touch me like you do, to-to-touch me like you do, oh<br>
        What are you, what are you waiting for?<br>
